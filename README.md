# Simple Neural Network in Python
A simple Neural Network designed as a workshop series to help students at the Brandeis Business School get started on Python-based projects and posting on GitHub.

Goal: to demonstrate how mathematical concepts can be implemented into code that produces results. 
 - Extensive comments provided in the .py file explaining all steps.
 - Examples/tests provided with the code, saved as comments. Remove the triple quotation marks to run tests.

Not-the-Goal: to demonstrate efficienct algorithms, Python package functionality, class inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
 - nested for-loop means the order of growth is n squared. Code is for teaching purposes ONLY
